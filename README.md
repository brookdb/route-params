# route-params

## Our goal is to set up the routing to display the correct contact based on the id in the url

### Tasks

- [ ] Set up a BrowserRouter in the index.tsx file with the structure you see in the picture (Don’t forget to import the components into index.tsx before including them in the router configuration).

- [ ] Utilize the ‘useParam( )’ hook to grab the url parameters associated with this route (aka id)

- [ ] Grab the contact details from the array using the id you just extracted from the url

### Setup

After you fork this project, clone the project to your computer and install the node modules

```
git clone < Repo URL >
cd route-params
npm i
npm start
```
